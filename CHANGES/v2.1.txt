Version 2.1.0 (Sep 15, 2014)
----------------------------

Version 2.1 contains several improvements with respect to 2.0. Users currently working with 2.0 
should have a look at the section "Changes leading to incompatible behavior" below and
might need tiny adjustments in their input files. In 2.1 we restored more features of 1.3
that were missing in 2.0, so users still working with 1.3 could opt for an upgrade.
A tutorial explaining how to move from PLUMED 1 to PLUMED 2 is available (see \ref moving).

Below you find a list of all the changes with respect to version 2.0.
Notice that version 2.1 includes already all the fixes in branch 2.0 up to 2.0.4.

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - \ref COORDINATION now skips pairs of one atom with itself.
  - Labels of quantities calculated by \ref BIASVALUE have changed from <i>label</i>.bias.<i>argname</i> to <i>label</i>.<i>argname</i>_bias, which is more consistent with steered MD
  - Labels of quantities calculated by \ref ABMD have change from <i>label</i>.min_<i>argname</i> to <i>label</i>.<i>argname</i>_min, which is more consistent with steered MD
  - For multicolvars components calculated with LESS_THAN and MORE_THAN keywords are now labelled lessthan and morethan. This change is necessary as the underscore
character now has a special usage in component names.
  - In \ref CONTACTMAP components are now labelled <i>label</i>.contact-\f$n\f$.
  - The command SPHERE has been replaced by \ref UWALLS.
- New configuration system based on autoconf (use ./configure from root directory).
  Optional packages are detected at compile time and correctly
  enabled or disabled. An internal version of lapack and blas will be used
  if these libraries are not installed.
- New actions:
  - \ref SPRINT topological collective variables.
  - \ref CH3SHIFTS collective variable.
  - \ref POSITION collective variable.
  - \ref FIT_TO_TEMPLATE.
  - \ref COMMITTOR analysis.
  - \ref LOCAL_AVERAGE.
  - \ref NLINKS.
  - \ref DIHCOR.
  - \ref NOE.
  - \ref RDC. 
  - \ref CLASSICAL_MDS.
  - \ref XDISTANCES.
  - \ref YDISTANCES.
  - \ref ZDISTANCES.
  - \ref DUMPMULTICOLVAR.
  - Crystallization module, including \ref Q3, \ref LOCAL_Q3, \ref Q4, \ref Q6, \ref LOCAL_Q4, \ref LOCAL_Q6, \ref MOLECULES, \ref SIMPLECUBIC, \ref TETRAHEDRAL and \ref FCCUBIC.
  - \ref ENSEMBLE to perform Replica-Averaging on any collective variable.
- New features for existing actions:
  - \ref METAD : WALKERS_MPI flag (multiple walkers in a mpi-based multi-replica framework),
    ACCELERATION flag (calculate on the fly the Metadynamics acceleration factor),
    TAU option (alternative way to set Gaussian height in well-tempered metadynamics),
    GRID_SPACING (alternative to GRID_BIN to set grid spacing).
    Notice that now one can also omit GRID_BIN and GRID_SPACING when using
    fixed size Gaussian, and the grid spacing will be automatically set.
  - \ref DISTANCE : added SCALED_COMPONENTS
  - \ref COORDINATION : if a single group is provided, it avoids permuted atom indexes and runs
    at twice the speed.
  - \ref DUMPATOMS : PRECISION option to set number of digits in output file.
  - \ref GROUP : NDX_FILE and NDX_GROUP options to import atom lists from ndx (gromacs) files.
  - In many multicolvars, MIN and MAX options can be used.
  - \ref HISTOGRAM : GRID_SPACING (alternative to GRID_BIN to set grid spacing),
    FREE-ENERGY flags in addition to standard probability density,
    additional option for KERNEL=DISCRETE to accumulate standard histograms. 
  - \ref sum_hills : added options --spacing (alternative to --bin to set grid spacing)
    and --setmintozero to translate the minimum of the output files to zero.
  - \ref CONTACTMAP : parallelised and added weights.
- New features in MD patches (require repatch):
  - New patch for Gromacs 5.0
  - Gromacs 4.6.X patch updated to 4.6.7
  - Gromacs 4.6.7 supports \ref COMMITTOR analysis; can be now be used to perform energy minimization;
     now passes temperature to PLUMED (this allows temperature to be omitted in some actions,
     namely \ref METAD and analysis actions).
  .
  Notice that if you use runtime binding it is not compulsory to repatch,
  and that all combinations should work correctly
  (new/old PLUMED with repatched/non-repatched MD code).
- Other new features:
  - \ref driver can now read trajectories in many formats using VMD molfile plugin
    (requires VMD plugins to be compiled and installed). In case VMD plugins are not installed,
    the configuration system falls back to an internal version which implements a minimal list
    of plugins (gromacs and dcd) (kindly provided by T. Giorgino).
  - \ref switchingfunction : added STRETCH flag.
  - Negative strides in atom ranges (e.g. ATOMS=10-1:-3 is expanded to ATOMS=10,7,4,1).
  - \ref COORDINATION and \ref DHENERGY with NLIST now work correctly in replica exchange simulations.
  - Multicolvars with neighbor lists now work correctly in replica exchange simulations.
  - Improved multicolvar neighbor lists.
- Optimizations:
  - Root-mean-square devations with align weights different from displace weights
    are now considerably faster. This will affect \ref RMSD calculations plus
    other variables based on RMSD.
  - \ref WHOLEMOLECULES is slighlty faster.
  - \ref COORDINATION is slighlty faster when NN and MM are even and D_0=0.
  - Atom scattering with domain decomposition is slightly faster.
  - Link cells are now exploited in some multicolvars.
  - Derivatives are not calculated unless they are specifically required, because for instance you are adding
    a bias.
- Documentation:
  - All tutorial material from the recent plumed meeting in Belfast is now in the manual
  - Improvements to documentation, including lists of referenceable quantities outputted by each action
  - Manual has been re-organized following suggestions received at the plumed meeting.
  - An experimental PDF version of the manual is now provided (a link can be found in the documentation homepage).

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for developers:
- Added regtests for plumed as a library (e.g. basic/rt-make-0). plumed command has an additional
  flag (--is-installed) to probe if running from a compilation directory or from a fully installed copy
  (this is needed for regtests to work properly).
- Improved class Communicator. Many operations can now be done directly on Vectors, Tensors, std::vector and PLMD::Matrix.
- Modified class RMSD.
- Patches for GPL codes (QuantumEspresso and Gromacs) now also include
  original code so as to simplify their modification.
- Fixed dependencies among actions such that it is now possible (and reliable)
  to use MPI calls inside Action::prepare()
- colvar/CoordinationBase.cpp has been changed to make it faster. If you devised a class which inherits from here,
  consider that CoordinationBase::pairing now needs _squared_ distance instead of distance
- It is possible to run "make install" from subdirectories (e.g. from src/colvar)
- There is a small script which disables/enables all optional modules (make mod-light/mod-heavy/mod-reset)
- Added "-q" option to plumed patch
- You can now create new metrics to measure distances from a reference configurations. If you do so such
  metrics can then be used in paths straightforwardly
- You can now use multicolvars in tandem with manyrestraints in order to add a large numbers of restraints.
- Can now do multicolvar like things in which each colvar is a vector rather than a scalar.
- Updated script that generated header files so that they properly show years. Notice that the script
  should new be run from within a git repository

This list is likely incompleted, if you are developing in PLUMED you are encouraged to follow changes on github.

Unreleased changes (will be included in 2.1.1)
----------------------------------------------
See <a href="http://github.com/plumed/plumed2/commits/v2.1">branch v2.1 on git repository</a>.

This release will include all the fixes available in branch 2.0.

For users:
- Fixed a portability issue in BG/P where gettimeofday is not implemented.
  Notice that this fix implies that one should execute again ./configure to have
  plumed timing working correctly.
- Small fixes in documentation.
- CS2Backbone: fixed a bug that resulted in only a fraction of the chemical shifts being printed with WRITE_CS and parallel simulations
  (requires to get the last almost updated from SVN)
- Fixed a linking issue with ALMOST, where bz2 was always used to link ALMOST to PLUMED even if it is not compulsory to build ALMOST.
- Fixed a wrong include in the GMX5 patch.
- \ref FUNCPATHMSD can now be used together with \ref CONTACTMAP to define pathways in contactmaps space
